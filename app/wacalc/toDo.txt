correct for historical bias
  anomaly to HadCrut data.

time period belonging to a certain warming level.

## Carl's Notes

* Internal Notes
** Issues:
- Treshold in the ensemble size: 10 is an arbitrary number

** Implementation
*** Rules
**** More than one scenarios given - derive targets always from the lowest one
**** For RCP26: Always take the 2080-2100 period
**** Derive the model ensemble warming bias relative to HadCrut4
*** ISIMIP
- Transient CS, mean of 5 ISIMIP-models is 1.88, mean of CMIP5 is 1.8. Use as mean


** Literature Check
*** Isimip
- had a similar problem
- picked 5 GCMs with very different ECS
- showed GCM specific impacts
- chose GCM specific time slices as outlined Schewe et al. (2013) Tab. S1
- Carl asked Jacob about our approach, he didn't see major obstacles
