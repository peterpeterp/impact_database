	Abstract = {Physically-based modelling demonstrates that the construction of simple retaining walls, a common practice at the individual household level, is unlikely to be an effective method of landslide risk reduction. A more appropriate approach is shown to be the comprehensive management of all forms of surface water through the construction of a network of drains to capture surface runoff, household roof-water and grey water.},

Actual coping mechanisms utilized after extreme events: savings; credits; wait and see (see Table 3 for results). 23{\%} of sample have high, 33{\%} moderate demand for micro-insurance, with dominating reasons against insurance being cost of premiums (44{\%}), lack of trust (27{\%}) (see page 107). Other limitations that affect the viability of insurance as an adaptation option include: affordability; the weakness of publicly-funded insurance schemes; lack of public knowledge of risks and insurance; difficulties in reaching a larger proportion of the population due to a shortage of information on local weather risks; and insufficient risk-management and risk- transfer experience on the part of the initiators.},

@article{Shah:2015it,
	Abstract = {We investigate household-level food security in the face of climatic change in coastal wetland-situated households in Trinidad and Tobago. These communities rely heavily, but not solely, on natural resources and agriculture for their livelihoods. Household data were collected for a representative sample of 138 households in the Nariva and Caroni communities. This included data on household adaptive capacity including socio-demographics, livelihood strategies, and social networks; exposure to climate change and climate-induced extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts; and sensitivity factors related to local access to services and infrastructure. Using ordinary least-squares regression analyses, we investigate influences of adaptive capacity to climate change on household food security in these `at-risk' communities. The results suggest that household socio-demographics and livelihood strategies are strongly related to food security and that the level of food security provided by those two factors is reduced in the face of climate variability and disaster. Social network capacity of households does not have a statistically significant influence in the context studied. This is a valuable insight for community and national planners and policy makers both in this and in similar country circumstances that must consider food security in light of climate variability and related weather-induced impacts.},

	Abstract = {An ecological study investigating risk factors for flood and storm lethality in CARICOM nations was conducted for the period 1980-2012. Biophysical and social vulnerability proxies and a decadal effect were examined as predictors of lethality (deaths vs. no deaths per disaster event). Significant positive associations were found between lethality and percentage of total land dedicated to agriculture and percentage urban population (i.e. urbanization). This fits with other research that suggests that well-preserved ecosystems in combination with infrastructure can offer could protection against the impacts of hurricanes. Deaths were more likely in the 2000-2012 period vs. 1980-1989, adding to evidence that population health in CARICOM nations is being increasingly impacted by climate-related disasters connected to increasing urbanization and land use patterns.},

@article{Forster2012a,
	Abstract = {Climate change could have major implications for the global tourism industry if changing environmental conditions alter the attractiveness of holiday destinations. Countries with economies dependent on tourism and with tourism industries reliant on vulnerable natural resources are likely to be particularly at risk. We investigate the implications that climate-induced variations in Atlantic hurricane activity may have for the tourism-dependent Caribbean island of Anguilla. Three hundred tourists completed standardised questionnaires and participated in a choice experiment to determine the influence hurricane risk has on their risk perceptions and decisions regarding holiday preferences. The hurricane season had been considered by 40 {\%} of respondents when making their holiday choice, and the beaches, climate and tranquility of the island were more important than coral reef-based recreational activities in determining holiday destination choice. Choice models demonstrated that respondents were significantly less likely to choose holiday options where hurricane risk is perceived to increase, and significantly more likely to choose options that offered financial compensation for increased risk. However, these choices and decisions varied among demographic groups, with older visitors, Americans, and people who prioritize beach- based activities tending to be most concerned about hurricanes. These groups comprise a significant component of the island's current clientele, suggesting that perceived increases in hurricane risk may have important implications for the tourism economy of Anguilla and similar destinations. Improved protection of key environmental features (e.g. beaches) may be necessary to enhance resilience to potential future climate impacts.},

@article{Hay2013,
	Abstract = {The intent of this paper is to place the con- cepts of exposure, vulnerability, resilience and risk in the context of the consequences of global change for the sustainable development of small island developing states (SIDS). Many such states face a number of global climate change risks, such as an increase in the propor- tion of more intense storms, along with other global change threats that include energy security and costs. All these threats come on top of local development threats, such as increased run-off, often with increasing levels of contaminants due to unsustainable agricultural and industrial practices. When taken together, the resulting pressures on islands and their communities lead to sig- nificant increases in vulnerability to change due to reduced resilience to these changes. Vulnerability is also increasing as a result of contemporary processes that heighten the exposure of material and other assets. The capacity to address hazard risk also influences vulnera- bility. This includes the level of awareness of coastal Handled by Donald L. Forbes, Geological Survey of Canada/Natural Resources Canada, Canada.

Vulnerability and resilience are considered to be important integrating concepts when managing the local consequences of global changes. There are many initiatives that will help reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of SIDS to such changes. These include improving risk knowledge and coastal resource and land use management, while also strengthening socio-economic systems and livelihoods. In this way, managing global change can be closely aligned with local development and humanitarian processes, thereby enhancing the overall sustainability of development processes and outcomes.

	Abstract = {Ocean acidification poses an increasing threat to marine ecosystems and also interacts with other anthropogenic environmental drivers. A planned response strategy could minimize exposure of socioeconomic systems to potential hazards and may even offer wider advantages. Response strategies can be informed by understanding the hazards, assessing exposure and assessing risks and opportunities. This paper assesses exposure of key socioeconomic systems to the hazards of ocean acidi- fication and analyzes the risks and opportunities of this exposure from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) perspectives. Key socioeconomic systems that are likely to be affected by ocean acidification are identified. A risk analysis matrix is developed to evaluate the risks or opportunities arising from ocean acidification. Analysis of the matrix reveals similarities and differences in potential adaptive responses at global and regional levels. For example, while ocean acidification poses significant threats to SIDS from more frequent toxic wild-caught seafood events and, potentially destruction of coral reef structure and habitat, SIDS may have a relative advantage in aquaculture and an important role to play in global marine ecosystem conservation.},

	Abstract = {Concerns over the status of freshwater availability in the Caribbean region and in particular the eastern Caribbean states have been expressed for at least the past 30 years. There is a growing realization that availability will be vulnerable to extremes of climate behavior and increasing demand for water. Climate modeling for the Caribbean region under a range of scenarios suggests a continuation of a warming in average temperatures, a lengthening of seasonal dry periods, and increases in frequency of occurrence of drought conditions. Using information from the most recent IPCC report and regional downscaling, the authors suggest what some of the macrolevel changes in temperature and rainfall might be and the implications for water resources availability. This article evaluates the existing availability of water resources, the implications of the most recent climate change modeling for the Caribbean region, and the impact of on existing service provision strategies.},

	Abstract = {This is the 9th status report since the global coral reef monitoring network (GCRMN) was founded in 1995. It reviews the status and changes observed in reefs over the period 1970-2012, covering biological abundance, anthropogenic drivers of coral reef degradation, and recommendations for management. The report also includes country reports for the countries, states and territories in the Caribbean, therefore giving quite a high level of resolution. Data were taken from more than 35,000 ecological surveys, making it the largest amount of quantitative coral reef survey data ever compiled (at the time of writing). Key findings: average coral cover for the wider Caribbean is 16.8{\%} (range 2.8-53.1{\%}), having been 34.8{\%} at the start of the period, and coral cover declined at ¾ of locations while macroalgal cover increased. Some locations showed more stability. Local stressors (tourism, overfishing and the resulting increase in macroalgae) have been the major drivers of catastrophic decline in corals up to today, but climate chance and ocean acidification may become more important in the future.},

	Abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is used to map areas predicted to be suitable for commercial banana production in Central and northwestern South America. Using the downscaled climate projections for 2060 from seven leading global climate models we then predict the geographical shifts in areas suitable for banana production. We repeat this process for conventional and organic banana production. Approximately half of the existing conventional plantations included in the analysis are located in areas predicted to become unsuitable for banana production by 2060. The overall extent of areas suitable for conventional banana cultivation is predicted to decrease by 19{\%}, but all countries are predicted to maintain some suitable areas. The extent of areas suitable for organic banana cultivation is predicted to nearly double due primarily to climatic drying. Several countries (e.g., Colombia and Honduras) are predicted to experience large net decreases in the extent of areas suitable for banana cultivation. Some countries (e.g., Mexico) are predicted to experience large net increases in the extent of suitable areas. The shifts in the location of areas that will be suitable for banana cultivation are predicted to occur mainly within areas outside of protected areas and that are already under agricultural production. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This paper hindcasted the potential relationship between recent ocean warming and outbreaks in white-band disease on acroporid corals, using eight SST metrics and records of the corals from 473 sites across the Caribbean, surveyed from 1997 to 2004. The results suggest that decades-long climate-driven changes in SST, increases in thermal minima, and the breach of thermal maxima have played significant roles in the spread of white-band disease, showing that this disease is strongly coupled with the thermal stresses associated with climate change.},

Therefore the loss of structural complexity in reefs due to human drivers (eutrophication, overfishing, climate change) may affect the survival and growth of reef fish. This paper uses data from an unfished reserve in the Bahamas to show that structural complexity is associated with increased biomass and abundance, as well as with nonlinearities in the size spectra of fish. These nonlinearities (i.e. the disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes) are shown to be explained by prey refugia, which reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Using a size-structured food web model, a loss of complexity was predicted to cause more than a 3-fold.},
