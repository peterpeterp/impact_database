	Abstract = {Physically-based modelling demonstrates that the construction of simple retaining walls, a common practice at the individual household level, is unlikely to be an effective method of landslide risk reduction. A more appropriate approach is shown to be the comprehensive management of all forms of surface water through the construction of a network of drains to capture surface runoff, household roof-water and grey water.},

	Abstract = {Case study in 4 islands. Actual coping mechanisms utilized after extreme events: savings; credits; wait and see (see Table 3 for results). 23{\%} of sample have high, 33{\%} moderate demand for micro-insurance, with dominating reasons against insurance being cost of premiums (44{\%}), lack of trust (27{\%}) (see page 107). Other limitations that affect the viability of insurance as an adaptation option include: affordability; the weakness of publicly-funded insurance schemes; lack of public knowledge of risks and insurance; difficulties in reaching a larger proportion of the population due to a shortage of information on local weather risks; and insufficient risk-management and risk- transfer experience on the part of the initiators.},
