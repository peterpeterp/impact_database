abstract = {Agriculture is a key component of anthropogenic land use and land cover changes that influence regional climate. Meanwhile, in addition to socioeconomic drivers, climate is another important factor shaping agricultural land use. In this study, we compare the contributions of climate change and socioeconomic development to potential future changes of agricultural land use in West Africa using a prototype land use projection (LandPro) algorithm. The algorithm is based on a balance between food supply and demand, and accounts for the impact of socioeconomic drivers on the demand side and the impact of climate-induced crop yield changes on the supply side. The impact of human decision-making on land use is explicitly considered through multiple "what-if" scenarios. In the application to West Africa, future crop yield changes were simulated by a process-based crop model driven with future climate projections from a regional climate model, and future changes in food demand were projected using a model for policy analysis of agricultural commodities and trade. Without agricultural intensification, the climate-induced decrease in crop yield together with increase in food demand are found to cause a significant increase in agricultural land use at the expense of forest and grassland by the mid-century. The increase in agricultural land use is primarily climate-driven in the western part of West Africa and socioeconomically driven in the eastern part. Analysis of results from multiple decision-making scenarios suggests that human adaptation characterized by science-informed decision making to minimize land use could be very effective in many parts of the region.},

abstract = {Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are confronted with climatic and non-climatic stressors. Research attention has focused on climatic stressors, such as rainfall variability, with few empirical studies exploring non-climatic stressors and how these interact with climatic stressors at multiple scales to affect food security and livelihoods. This focus on climatic factors restricts understanding of the combinations of stressors that exacerbate the vulnerability of farming households and hampers the development of holistic climate change adaptation policies. This study addresses this particular research gap by adopting a multi-scale approach to understand how climatic and non-climatic stressors vary, and interact, across three spatial scales (household, community and district levels) to influence livelihood vulnerability of smallholder farming households in the Savannah zone of northern Ghana. This study across three case study villages utilises a series of participatory tools including semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. The incidence, importance, severity and overall risk indices for stressors are calculated at the household, community, and district levels. Results show that climatic and non-climatic stressors were perceived differently; yet, there were a number of common stressors including lack of money, high cost of farm inputs, erratic rainfall, cattle destruction of crops, limited access to markets and lack of agricultural equipment that crossed all scales. Results indicate that the gender of respondents influenced the perception and severity assessment of stressors on rural livelihoods at the community level. Findings suggest a mismatch between local and district level priorities that have implications for policy and development of agricultural and related livelihoods in rural communities. Ghana's climate change adaptation policies need to take a more holistic approach that integrates both climatic and non-climatic factors to ensure policy coherence between national climate adaptation plans and District development plans. {\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract = {This paper develops and links highly resolved models of physical, biological and human responses to climate change in 67 marine national exclusive economic zones (60{\%} of global fish catches) to project climate change yield impacts in countries with different dependencies on marine fisheries. Productivity is projected to increase at high latitudes and decrease at mid-low latitudes, with considerable regional variation. Changes by 2050 are largely expected to be {\textless}10{\%} from present yields. Of the regions that are most dependent on fisheries, climate change is expected to increase productive potential in West Africa (from Benin to Mauritania) and decrease it in South and Southeast Asia, and in Southwest Africa (from Nigeria to Namibia). Technological development in aquaculture suggests that projected global fish demands in 2050 could be met, although this requires successful implementation of strategies for sustainable harvesting and effective distribution of wild fish products from nations and regions with a surplus to those with a deficit. Changes in management effectiveness and trade practices will remain the main influence on gains or losses in global fish production. For example, in West Africa nations where production in the EEZs is projected to increase by 2050, governments must ensure that distant water fishing nations do not jeopardize local opportunities to benefit from increased productivity. Methods: a highly resolved coupled physical-biological shelf-seas model was forced using the IPSL-CM4 GCM A1B scenarios, and applied to 67 marine national EEZs.},

abstract = {This paper reviews impacts and discusses potential adaptation strategies adopted by the artisanal and industrial fishing sectors. Both climate change and over-exploitation have altered species composition of catches. Climate change impacts on West African fisheries are projected to be mainly negative (although modelling outputs disagree over the direction of change in some regions). Warmer water species are increasing in dominance. Regardless of the differences in projected climate change effects, the ultimate impacts on local communities will depend on adaptive capacity, which is not well-studied. Both artisanal and industrial sectors may adapt by expanding the fishing ground, even though this increases operation costs. Historically, it is more common for industrial fisheries to change the target species than for artisanal fisheries, which challenges the prevailing assumption that artisanal fisheries would adapt by shifting target species and/or gear type. The preference of artisanal fisheries to “follow the fish” rather than change gear / species may be due to traditional diets and available markets. An increase in fishing costs may lead to a reduction in fishing effort, which while good for fisheries may mean loss of livelihoods, especially as in West Africa the opportunities for alternative livelihoods are limited. Methods: literature review of the impacts of climate change on two West African large marine ecosystems (economic performance, biologic productivity and diversity), the changes witnessed by industrial and artisanal fisheries in response to changing conditions, and the adaptation measures used by artisanal and industrial fisheries to similar changes (whether due to climate change or other stressors).},

Some fisheries benefit – tuna are expected to be more abundant in the east and freshwater aquaculture and fisheries are likely to become more productive. Conversely, coral reef fisheries could decrease by 20{\%} by 2050 and coastal aquaculture may be less efficient (this is more difficult to model). The paper also shows how social and economic implications can be addressed: tuna and freshwater aquaculture can help to support growing populations as coral reefs, costal fisheries and mariculture decline. The introduction gives a good overview of how important fishing is to the economies and food security of Pacific islands. The paper also lists further research needs. Methods: changes to the topical Pacific Ocean and surface climate from the SRES A2 emissions scenario were cascaded along direct and indirect pathways to show which oceanic, coastal and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture resources will be affected by 2035, 2050 and 2100, and how this will affect economic development, food security, and livelihoods.

They use the vulnerability assessment performed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (Bell et al. 2011) to describe the main oceanic fisheries in the tropical Pacific, summarise existing benefits, outline the plans for maintaining or improving these benefits, examine how tuna could be affected by a high GHG gas scenario to 2100, evaluate the implications of projected changes in contributions of oceanic fisheries to Pacific island economies and communities, and identify the key adaptations needed (win-win and lose-win options). To determine the economic effects, they use historic GDP and revenues from fisheries together with projected changes in tuna catch from Lehodey et al. 2011. Islands in the east are projected to receive increased economic benefits, but by 2050 the expected decline in catches in the west more than offsets the increase in the east (although islands in the west tend to be the more economically reliant on fisheries). The impacts on food security are relatively minor compared to the effects of population growth, and those more vulnerable islands must allocate an adequate proportion of their average tuna catches to national food security.},

abstract = {Increasing globalization has promoted the spread of exotic species, including disease vectors. Understanding the evolutionary processes involved in such colonizations is both of intrinsic biological interest and important to predict and mitigate future dis-ease risks. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, the worldwide spread of which has been facilitated by Ae. aegypti's adaption to human-modified environments. Understanding the evolutionary processes involved in this invasion requires characterization of the genetic make-up of the source population (s). The application of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to sequence data from four nuclear and one mitochondrial marker revealed that African populations of Ae. aegypti best fit a demographic model of lineage diversification, historical admixture and recent population structuring. As ancestral Ae. aegypti were dependent on forests, this population history is consistent with the effects of forest fragmentation and expansion driven by Pleistocene climatic change. Alternatively, or additionally, histori-cal human movement across the continent may have facilitated their recent spread and mixing. ABC analysis and haplotype networks support earlier inferences of a single out-of-Africa colonization event, while a cline of decreasing genetic diversity indicates that Ae. aegypti moved first from Africa to the Americas and then to Asia. ABC analy-sis was unable to verify this colonization route, possibly because the genetic signal of admixture obscures the true colonization pathway. By increasing genetic diversity and forming novel allelic combinations, divergence and historical admixture within Africa could have provided the adaptive potential needed for the successful worldwide spread of Ae. aegypti.},

abstract = {Semi-arid areas are found in a large number of countries and regions of Africa and South and Central Asia. They display high vulnerability to climate change with considerable adaptation needs. In this paper, we review country-level and multi-country projects supported by international agencies. We examine the priorities and goals presented in national adaptation planning documents and in sectorial planning documents. Through this analysis, we seek to compare adaptation needs with current trends in national, regional and global projects and collaborations. Our results suggest that initiatives supported by international agencies play a considerable role in achieving national adaptation priorities, especially in areas such as agriculture and water management. However, compared with specific adaptation options such as drought-resistant species and irrigation (which tend to be the scope of the projects), the analyzed documents tend to see challenges in agriculture more in the contexts of food security, livestock and rural development. They emphasize the strong connection between rural livelihoods and sustainable land and ecosystem management. Priorities listed in the national documents but not captured in current initiatives include human health, pastoralism, security and migration. Our results also show high levels of mainstreaming adaptation into sectorial planning documents, especially those on poverty reduction; however, compared with the focus on the project level, they here emphasize adaptations focused on institutional development and governance. Finally, the outcomes indicate that global, regional and national initiatives are distributed unequally and that countries in Central and West Africa and Central Asia currently exhibit low participation, especially in national projects.},

abstract = {Increased understanding of the substantial threat climate change poses to agriculture has not been met with a similarly improved understanding of how best to respond. Here we examine likely shifts in crop climates in Sub-Saharan Africa under climate change to 2050, and explore the implications for agricultural adaptation, with particular focus on identifying priorities in crop breeding and the conservation of crop genetic resources. We find that for three of Africa's primary cereal crops - maize, millet, and sorghum - expected changes in growing season temperature are considerable and dwarf changes projected for precipitation, with the warmest recent temperatures on average cooler than almost 9 out of 10 expected observations by 2050. For the "novel" crop climates currently unrepresented in each country but likely extant there in 2050, we identify current analogs across the continent. The majority of African countries will have novel climates over at least half of their current crop area by 2050. Of these countries, 75{\%} will have novel climates with analogs in the current climate of at least five other countries, suggesting that international movement of germplasm will be necessary for adaptation. A more troubling set of countries - largely the hotter Sahelian countries - will have climates with few analogs for any crop. Finally, we identify countries, such as Sudan, Cameroon, and Nigeria, whose current crop areas are analogs to many future climates but that are poorly represented in major genebanks - promising locations in which to focus future genetic resource conservation efforts. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper uses maximum catch potential and species turnover as climate-risk indicators for fisheries. They project that potential catches will decrease by more than 3 million metric tons per degree Celsius of warming. Species turnover is more than halved when warming is lowered from 3.5˚C to 1.5˚C above the preindustrial level. Regionally, changes in maximum catch potential and species turnover vary across ecosystems, with the biggest risk reduction in the Indo-Pacific and Arctic regions when the Paris Agreement target is achieved. Regional scaling between fisheries impacts and The outputs from 19 Earth system models from CMIP5 under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5 were used to evaluate the relationship between projected warming from 1950 to 2100 and changes in oceanographic variables that drive changes in large marine ecosystems. This showed a near linear relationship between ecosystem drivers at the sea surface (averaged over all large marine ecosystems) and global warming. A Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope model (DBEM) is then used to simulate interactions between changes in ocean conditions, population dynamics, habitat productivity etc. for 892 species of exploited marine fish. Note that the DBEM assumes no evolutionary adaptation to warming, and the impacts of changes in coral reefs or estuaries are not included. High uncertainties in ecosystem driver projections makes interpretation for small-scale and recreational fisheries more difficult. The study also doesn't consider the effects of ocean acidification and interactions with other drivers (e.g. pollution, socioeconomic development).},

Multiple biophysical, political, and socioeconomic stresses interact to increase the region's susceptibility and constrain its adaptive capacity. Climate change is commonly recognized as a major issue likely to have negative consequences on food security and livelihoods in the region. This paper reviews three bodies of scholarship that have evolved somewhat separately, yet are inherently interconnected: climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation, food security, and sustainable livelihoods. The paper develops a conceptualization of the relationships among the three themes and shows how food security's vulnerabilities are related to multiple stresses and adaptive capacities, reflecting access to assets. Food security represents one of several livelihood outcomes. The framework shows how several research paradigms relate to the issue of food security and climate change and provides a guide for empirical investigations. Recognizing these interconnections can help in the development of more effective policies and programs. The framework is applied here to synthesize findings from an array of studies in sub-Saharan Africa dealing with vulnerability to climate change, food security, and livelihoods.},

abstract = {This paper reviews research on African climate from the major Sahel droughts in the early 1970s to current interest in improving the use of climate science within societal decision-making processes. During the last decade, and particularly since the mid-2000s, the development community has begun to engage seriously with the issue of climate change and its implications for the world's poor. This has led to a growing interaction with the climate research community.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nRecent climate literature is used to explore four research themes and identify knowledge gaps and areas with potential to adapt climate research for development needs. The first theme considers the development and use of seasonal forecasts and their portrayal by some as a relative success story, but with important skill limitations and need for much greater interaction with users. Forecast use is set within a wider context of generally low scientific understanding of the drivers of Africa's high climate variability and low research capacity. The second theme addresses the main influences on African climate variability and their response to climate change; high levels of uncertainty for future rainfall in some regions where remote influences are poorly resolved in global climate models. The third theme summarizes key elements of climate impacts research and shows a situation of rather ad hoc case studies and little engagement with decision-makers. Recent studies reveal an important move to couple more effectively impacts research with adaptation by focusing on the near future and drawing on current climate–society relationships. The fourth theme looks at the emerging evidence of anthropogenic climate change and secondary effects on African environments and, apart from widespread warming, shows an equivocal situation with evidence for anthropogenic ocean warming affecting regional rainfall. Detection is hampered by data availability and high levels of background variability.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFinally, three emergent issues are discussed: (1) reflection on African climate research capacity and international collaboration suggests it is timely to review experiences from recent climate programs in Africa; (2) attempts to untangle climate signals from within complex livelihood systems face significant methodological challenges. These include the need to reconcile scientific observations and local perceptions and to clarify views that may over-simplify climate–society interactions, to avoid construction of a crisis narrative on Africa and climate change; (3) the challenge of linking climate science with decision-making to inform adaptation. Demand for information and confidence often exceeds what climate science can realistically achieve in many parts of Africa},

abstract = {The impact of a +2. °C global warming on temperature and precipitation over tropical Africa is examined, based on an ensemble of 12 regional climate model scenario simulations. These 12 scenarios are re-phased so that they all correspond to the same global warming of 2. °C with respect to pre-industrial conditions. The continental temperature increase is above the global average. If heat waves are defined with the same temperature threshold in the reference climate and in the scenario, their frequency increases by a factor of 10. When the temperature threshold is adapted to future conditions, there is still a slight increase in frequency. The average precipitation does not show a significant response, due to model-to-model spread. However two compensating phenomena occur, which are robust among the models: (a) the number of rain days decreases whereas the precipitation intensity increases, and (b) the rain season occurs later during the year with less precipitation in early summer and more precipitation in late summer. Simulated daily temperature and precipitation data are combined in two impact models, one for the hydrology of the Nile and Niger basins, one for the food security of the different countries. They show that the main feature of the climate change is not a continuous trend signal, but an alternation of dry and wet decadal to multidecadal episodes.},

abstract = {African mixed crop–livestock systems are vulnerable to climate change and need to adapt in order to improve productivity and sustain people's livelihoods. These smallholder systems are characterized by high greenhouse gas emission rates, but could play a role in their mitigation. Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop–livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems. Building on agricultural system model development, integrated impact assessments and scenario analyses can inform the co-design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies.F},

abstract = {Adaptation strategies to reduce smallholder farmers' vulnerability to climate variability and seasonality are needed given the frequency of extreme weather events predicted to increase during the next decades in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in West Africa. We explored the linkages between selected agricultural adaptation strategies (crop diversity, soil and water conservation, trees on farm, small ruminants, improved crop varieties, fertilizers), food security, farm household characteristics and farm productivity in three contrasting agro-ecological sites in West Africa (Burkina Faso, Ghana and Senegal). Differences in land area per capita and land productivity largely explained the variation in food security across sites. Based on land size and market orientation, four household types were distinguished (subsistence, diversified, extensive, intensified), with contrasting levels of food security and agricultural adaptation strategies. Income increased steadily with land size, and both income and land productivity increased with degree of market orientation. The adoption of agricultural adaptation strategies was widespread, although the intensity of practice varied across household types. Adaptation strategies improve the food security status of some households, but not all. Some strategies had a significant positive impact on land productivity, while others reduced vulnerability resulting in a more stable cash flow throughout the year. Our results show that for different household types, different adaptation strategies may be `climate-smart'. The typology developed in this study gives a good entry point to analyse which practices should be targeted to which type of smallholder farmers, and quantifies the effect of adaptation options on household food security. Subsequently, it will be crucial to empower farmers to access, test and modify these adaptation options, if they were to achieve higher levels of food security.},

In this paper, we document and characterize the current status of adaptation in 47 vulnerable ‘hotspot' nations in Asia and Africa, based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature, as well as policy documents, to extract evidence of adaptation initiatives. In total, 100 peer-reviewed articles, 161 grey literature documents, and 27 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change National Communications were reviewed, constituting 760 adaptation initiatives. Results indicate a significant increase in reported adaptations since 2006. Adaptations are primarily being reported from African and low-income countries, particularly those nations receiving adaptation funds, involve a combination of groundwork and more concrete adaptations to reduce vulnerability, and are primarily being driven by national governments, NGOs, and international institutions, with minimal involvement of lower levels of government or collaboration across nations. Gaps in our knowledge of adaptation policy and practice are particularly notable in North Africa and Central Asia, and there is limited evidence of adaptation initiatives being targeted at vulnerable populations including socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, children, indigenous peoples, and the elderly.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IAHSThis review article discusses the climate, water resources and historical droughts of Africa, drought indices, vulnerability, impact of global warming and land use for drought-prone regions in West, southern and the Greater Horn of Africa, which have suffered recurrent severe droughts in the past. Recent studies detected warming and drying trends in Africa since the mid 20th century. Based on the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), both northern and southern Africa are projected to experience drying, such as decreasing precipitation, runoff and soil moisture in the 21st century and could become more vulnerable to the impact of droughts. The daily maximum temperature is projected to increase by up to 8°C (RCP8.5 of CMIP5), precipitation indices such as total wet day precipitation (PRCPTOT) and heavy precipitation days (R10 mm) could decrease, while warm spell duration (WSDI) and consecutive dry days (CDD) could increase. Uncertainties of the above long-term projections, teleconnections to climate anomalies such as ENSO and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which could also affect the water resources of Africa, and capacity building in terms of physical infrastructure and non-structural solutions are also discussed. Given that traditional climate and hydrological data observed in Africa are generally limited, satellite data should also be exploited to fill the data gap for Africa in the future. EDITOR D.

abstract = {This paper documents and predicts long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. After loss of {\textgreater}90{\%} live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral status, while 9 reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy microalgae. Regime shifting reefs saw changes in functional diversity of reef fish communities. The paper identifies threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event – recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories, which can guide improved management and adaptation. Methods: they use a 17-year data set across the inner islands of the Seychelles, which were the most severely affected globally by the 1998 coral bleaching event. Note that the study was conducted in the Indian Ocean, but the findings were also checked with data from 6 other countries, including Fiji.},

abstract = {In the coming decades, the already fragile agricultural system in West Africa will face further challenges in meeting food security, both from increasing population and from the impacts of climate change. Optimal prioritization of adaptation investments requires the assessment of various possible adaptation options and their uncertainties; successful adaptations of agriculture to climate change should not only help farmers deal with current climate risks, but also reduce negative (or enhance positive) impacts associated with climate change using robust climate projections. Here, we use two well-validated crop models (APSIM v7.5 and SARRA-H v3.2) and an ensemble of downscaled climate forcing from the CMIP5 models to assess five possible and realistic adaptation options for the production of the staple crop sorghum (Sorghum bicolor Moench.): (i) late sowing, (ii) intensification of seeding density and fertilizer use, (iii) increasing cultivars??? thermal time requirement, (iv) water harvesting, and (v) increasing resilience to heat stress during the flowering period. We adopt a new assessment framework to account for both the impacts of proposed adaptation options in the historical climate and their ability to reduce the impacts of future climate change, and we also consider changes in both mean yield and inter-annual yield variability. We target the future period of 2031???2060 for the ???business-as-usual??? scenario (RCP8.5), and compare with the historical period of 1961???1990. Our results reveal that most proposed ???adaptation options??? are not more beneficial in the future than in the historical climate (???12{\%} to +4{\%} in mean yield), so that they do not really reduce the climate change impacts. Increased temperature resilience during the grain number formation period is the main adaptation that emerges (+4.5{\%}). Intensification of fertilizer inputs can dramatically benefit yields in the historical/current climate (+50{\%}), but does not reduce negative climate change impacts except in scenarios with substantial rainfall increases. Water harvesting contributes to a small benefit in the current climate (+1.5{\%} to +4.0{\%}) but has little additional benefit under climate change. Our analysis of uncertainties arising from crop model differences (conditioned on the used model versions) and various climate model projections provide insights on how to further constrain uncertainties for assessing future climate adaptation options.},

However, substantial interannual and interdecadal variability, which are larger locally than globally, mean that it is not possible to say if recent trends in the Cook Islands region are representative of longer-term trends, or if longer-term trends have increased recently. Local fisheries management decisions should therefore focus on observations at the local and regional scales. For example, in the short-term (the next 10-20 years) interannual variability in sea level is likely to provide a larger impact on low-lying islands than change in sea level, but sea level rise will become a big concern on a century time scale.},

abstract = {The freshwater resources of small islands are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and human stressors due to their limited extent and adaptive capacity. A water security approach is useful for effective management of the water resources; however, understanding risk to water security is critical in order to effectively plan and adapt to future changes. Currently available assessment tools generally do not incorporate risk and are not suitable for application on small islands, where the hydrogeological setting has unique vulnerabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a framework to characterize risk to water security for small islands. The risk assessment was developed using Andros Island, the Bahamas, as a case study area. Numerical modelling characterizes the response of the water system to potential future stressors related to climate change and human development, the results of which are integrated into the assessment framework. Based on risk assessment principles, indicators are determined for susceptibility, hazard threat, vulnerability and loss, in order to define the risk to water security. The resulting indicators are presented in geospatial maps that rank areas of risk to water security. These maps were provided to local water managers and policy-makers in the Bahamas as a tool to identify high-risk areas for near-term action and to inform long-term planning. The maps have also been used as a platform to engage local residents and raise awareness about the impact climate change and land-use activities may have on water security.},

abstract = {Building resilience to climate change in agricultural production can ensure the functioning of agricultural-based livelihoods and reduce their vulnerability to climate change impacts. This paper thus explores how buffer capacity, a characteristic feature of resilience, can be conceptualised and used for assessing the resilience of smallholder agriculture to climate change. It uses the case of conservation agriculture farmers in a Kenyan region and examines how their practices contribute to buffer capacity. Surveys were used to collect data from 41 purposely selected conservation agriculture farmers in the Laikipia region of Kenya. Besides descriptive statistics, factor analysis was used to identify the key dimensions that characterise buffer capacity in the study context. The cluster of practices characterising buffer capacity in conservation agriculture include soil protection, adapted crops, intensification/irrigation, mechanisation and livelihood diversification. Vario! us conservation practices increase buffer capacity, evaluated by farmers in economic, social, ecological and other dimensions. Through conservation agriculture, most farmers improved their productivity and incomes despite drought, improved their environment and social relations. Better-off farmers also reduced their need for labour, but this resulted in lesser income-earning opportunities for the poorer farmers, thus reducing the buffer capacity and resilience of the latter.},

The report also includes country reports for the countries, states and territories in the Caribbean, therefore giving quite a high level of resolution. Data were taken from more than 35,000 ecological surveys, making it the largest amount of quantitative coral reef survey data ever compiled (at the time of writing). Key findings: average coral cover for the wider Caribbean is 16.8{\%} (range 2.8-53.1{\%}), having been 34.8{\%} at the start of the period, and coral cover declined at ¾ of locations while macroalgal cover increased. Some locations showed more stability. Local stressors (tourism, overfishing and the resulting increase in macroalgae) have been the major drivers of catastrophic decline in corals up to today, but climate chance and ocean acidification may become more important in the future.},

abstract = {This paper uses climate-living marine resources simulation models to show that global fisheries revenues could drop by 35{\%} more than the projected decrease in catches by the 2050s under high CO2 emission scenarios. Regionally, the projected increases in fish catch at high latitudes may not translate into revenues because of the increasing dominance of low value fish, and the decrease in catches by these countries' vessels operating in more severely impacted distant waters. Developing countries with high fisheries dependency are negatively impacted. The greatest negative impact in maximum catch potential was found in tropical regions with EEZs in the Pacific, e.g. -79{\%} in Tuvalu and -70{\%} in Kiribati, both of which are highly dependent on fisheries for food and livelihoods. The impact on maximum revenue potential is particularly great in low HDI countries where the marine resources in their own EEZs are exploited and threatened by distant water fishing (e,g. West Africa), or where fisheries make an important contribution to GDP (e.g. Tuvalu). The results suggest that full-fledged economic analyses of the potential economic effects of climate change on global marine fisheries should be conducted. Methods: the paper applies outputs of coupled Earth System Models (from CMIP5) with Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Models (DBEM). The DBEM was used to project changes in distributions, abundances and catches by 2050 for each of the 887 marine fish and invertebrate species on a half degree x half degree grid of the ocean under RCPs 2.6 and 8.5. The outputs were then linked to the global marine catch and fisheries economic databases to project the impact on revenues of each coastal country, including catches from fishing in the EEZs and high seas. The effects of different sea food price scenarios were also examined.},

abstract = {The 2008 food crisis has challenged the political legitimacy and economic efficiency of the liberalization of international agricultural trade. An alternative vision defended by the food sovereignty movement is that long-term food security cannot rely on dependency on food imports, but must be built on the development of domestic production with enough barrier protection to shelter it from world price fluctuations and unfair trading.The purpose of this paper is to look into whether the West African nations can achieve food sovereignty given their various trade commitments and other external constraints. The particularity of our approach is to combine a historical economic analysis with a political approach to food sovereignty and trade commitments.Our results suggest that external brakes on the development of food sovereignty policies are marginal, as the countries still have unused room for manoeuvre to protect their smallholder agriculture under the terms of draft World Trade Organization agreements and Economic Partnership Agreements and under the international financial institutions' recommendations. Rather the international environment seems to be instrumented by West African states that do not manage to secure a national political consensus to drive structural reforms deemed vital and further the food security of the urban populations over the marginalized rural populations. Recently, the regional integration process has made headway with a common agricultural support and protection policy project that could herald an internal political balance more conducive to food-producing agriculture. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {New approaches are needed to accelerate understanding of climate impacts on crop yields, particularly in tropical regions. Past studies have relied mainly on crop-simulation models1, 2 or statistical analyses based on reported harvest data3, 4, each with considerable uncertainties and limited applicability to tropical systems. However, a wealth of historical crop-trial data exists in the tropics that has been previously untapped for climate research. Using a data set of more than 20,000 historical maize trials in Africa, combined with daily weather data, we show a nonlinear relationship between warming and yields. Each degree day spent above 30 C reduced the final yield by 1{\%} under optimal rain-fed conditions, and by 1.7{\%} under drought conditions. These results are consistent with studies of temperate maize germplasm in other regions, and indicate the key role of moisture in maizes ability to cope with heat. Roughly 65{\%} of present maize-growing areas in Africa would experience yield losses for 1 C of warming under optimal rain-fed management, with 100{\%} of areas harmed by warming under drought conditions. The results indicate that data generated by international networks of crop experimenters represent a potential boon to research aimed at quantifying climate impacts and prioritizing adaptation responses, especially in regions such as Africa that are typically thought to be data-poor.},

We here explore the spread of climate change impact projections and develop a composite impact measure to identify hotspots of climate change impacts, addressing likelihood and strength of impacts. Overlapping impacts in different biosphere properties (e.g. flooding, yields) will not only claim additional capacity to respond, but will also narrow the options to respond and develop.

Approximately half of the existing conventional plantations included in the analysis are located in areas predicted to become unsuitable for banana production by 2060. The overall extent of areas suitable for conventional banana cultivation is predicted to decrease by 19{\%}, but all countries are predicted to maintain some suitable areas. The extent of areas suitable for organic banana cultivation is predicted to nearly double due primarily to climatic drying. Several countries (e.g., Colombia and Honduras) are predicted to experience large net decreases in the extent of areas suitable for banana cultivation. Some countries (e.g., Mexico) are predicted to experience large net increases in the extent of suitable areas.

abstract = {The parasitic weed Rhamphicarpa fistulosa is threatening rainfed lowland rice production in Benin. The aim of this study was to explore factors (such as biophysical characters of the rice growing environment, farmers' management practices, and socioeconomic characteristics) that affect the infestation of rainfed lowland rice fields by R. fistulosa and farmers' ability to cope with the problem. Data were collected from 231 rice plots located in 12 inland valleys infested by Rhamphicarpa in Benin. Data were analyzed using a double hurdle model, which analyses both the likelihood (of occurrence) and the severity of infestation. Results showed that 72{\%} of the surveyed rice plots were infested by R. fistulosa and the average severity was 109 plants m-2. The likelihood of infestation was higher on poorly fertile soils and fields located in the inland-valley bottom, and it decreases through timely use of herbicides and ploughing. Severity of infestation was higher on rice plots cultivated by female-headed households farmers and reduced through management practices such as late sowing, timely application of post-emergence herbicide, three hoe or hand weeding operations, medium-rate fertilizer application and prolonged fallow. Likelihood and severity of infestation were found to be negatively correlated. These findings suggest that farmers can reduce the likelihood and the severity of infestation of their plot as long as they are aware of factors causing the problem given their access to and management capacity of production resources. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Sahel region has one of the most mobile populations in the world, with migration serving as a common household strategy to increase livelihood and social resilience. However, the Sahel region's population is extremely heterogeneous, and the processes and factors that contribute to migration are complex. Consequently, recent empirical studies yielded conflicting conclusions regarding the processes that drive migration. This study was designed to increase our understanding of the factors that drive migration in the Sahel region. We performed a systematic meta-analysis of English-language literature to synthesise the empirical evidence collected from 53 case studies covering eight Sahelian countries. We analysed the frequencies of a broad range of drivers that affected migration processes during the past three decades. Our results show that the primary impetus for driving migration is a combination of economic and social motivations, which together account for 80{\%} of all drivers that were identified in the case studies. In contrast, only 11{\%} of the identified drivers are related directly to demographic and/or environmental conditions. Moreover, we conclude that the majority of case studies do not explore causation among migration drivers, which clearly hampers our understanding of migration mechanisms taking place in the Sahel region.

abstract = {Overall this paper shows how even if carbon emissions are reduced drastically in the next decade, there would still be extreme thermal events every 3 to 4 years between 2040 to 2080 because of the carbon already stored in the atmosphere, and this means benefits to the health of corals will only be noticeable in the long-term. A spatially explicit ecosystem model is used to compare the potential ecosystem benefits that Caribbean and Pacific reefs could gain from reductions in carbon emissions, and the timescale of these benefits. While a reduction in emissions will have a modest effect on Caribbean reefs, and will only be realised in the long term (more than 60 years), Pacific reefs would start to show benefits within the first half of this century and have the potential to maintain their ecological integrity and ecosystem state in the mid- to long-term if carbon emissions are reduced. Tabular corals and corymbose acroporides play a key role in maintaining the recovery potential of Pacific reefs. Note that this study doesn't consider the effects of cyclones, crown-of-thorns starfish or thermal stress on calcification.},

@article{Ouedraogo:2016ge,
abstract = {Agricultural practices have constantly changed in West Africa, and understanding the factors that have driven the changes may help guide strategies to promote sustainable agriculture in the region. To contribute to such efforts, this paper analyzes drivers of change in farming practices in the region using data obtained from surveys of 700 farming households in five countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal). The results showed that farmers have adopted various practices in response to the challenges they have faced during the last decade. A series of logit models showed that most changes farmers made to their practices are undertaken for multiple reasons. Land use and management changes including expanding farmed areas and using mineral fertilization and manure are positively related to perceived changes in the climate, such as more erratic rainfall. Planting new varieties, introducing new crops, crop rotation, expanding farmed area and using pesticides are positively associated with new market opportunities. Farm practices that require relatively high financial investment such as use of pesticides, drought-tolerant varieties and improved seeds were positively associated with the provision of technical and financial support for farmers through development projects and policies. Changes in markets and climate are both helping to promote needed changes in farming practices in West Africa. Therefore, policies that foster the development of markets for agricultural products, and improved weather- and climate-related information linked to knowledge of appropriate agricultural innovations in different environments are needed.},

abstract = {In this paper we examine conditions that underlie vulnerability and resilience possibilities for households and communities that face and respond to climate- and other changes, in nine East and West African countries. We base our analysis on a unique integrated qualitative and quantitative dataset composed of household surveys and village focus group studies carried out across a wide range of environments and agricultural systems. We identify human population growth, commercialization of the economy, and natural resource use policies, in addition to weather, as key drivers of change. We compare the agricultural and livelihood systems of male and female respondents, as well as their productive resources, organization and access to services. Women have less access than men to common property resources, as well as to cash to obtain goods or services. Women control less land than men, the land they control is often of poorer quality, and their tenure is insecure. Women engage in mutual insurance and risk-sharing networks, and benefit from non-agricultural services provided by social support institutions external to the village. Formally registered, public and private external organizations that foster agriculture and livestock production have tremendous anti-women biases, and tend to provide support primarily to men. Policies and strategies are needed to eliminate those prejudices so that men and women increase their resilience and manage well their changing environments.},

abstract = {The West African monsoon intraseasonal vari- ability has huge socio-economic impacts on local popu- lations but understanding and predicting it still remains a challenge for the weather prediction and climate scientific community. This paper analyses an ensemble of simula- tions from six regional climate models (RCMs) taking part in the coordinated regional downscaling experiment, the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis (ERAI) and three satellite-based and observationally-constrained daily pre- cipitation datasets, to assess the performance of the RCMs with regard to the intraseasonal variability. A joint analy- sis of seasonal-mean precipitation and the total column water vapor (also called precipitable water—PW) suggests the existence of important links at different timescales between these two variables over the Sahel and highlights the relevance of using PW to follow the monsoon seasonal cycle. RCMs that fail to represent the seasonal-mean posi- tion and amplitude of the meridional gradient of PW show the largest discrepancies with respect to seasonal-mean observed precipitation. For both ERAI and RCMs, spec- tral decompositions of daily PW as well as rainfall show an overestimation of low-frequency activity (at timescales longer than 10 days) at the expense of the synoptic (time- scales shorter than 10 days) activity. Consequently, the effects of the African Easterly Waves and the associated mesoscale convective systems are substantially underes- timated, especially over continental regions. Finally, the study investigates the skill of the models with respect to hydro-climatic indices related to the occurrence, intensity and frequency of precipitation events at the intraseasonal scale. Although most of these indices are generally bet- ter reproduced with RCMs than reanalysis products, this study indicates that RCMs still need to be improved (espe- cially with respect to their subgrid-scale parameterization schemes) to be able to reproduce the intraseasonal vari- ance spectrum adequately.},

abstract = {Many definitions of food security exist, and these have been the subject of much debate. As early as 1992, Maxwell and Smith (1992) reviewed more than 180 items discussing concepts and definitions, and more definitions have been formulated since (DEFRA, 2006). Whereas many earlier definitions centered on food production, more recent definitions highlight access to food, in keeping with the 1996 World Food Summit definition (FAO, 1996) that food security is met when “all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life.” Worldwide attention on food access was given impetus by the food “price spike” in 2007–2008, triggered by a complex set of long- and short-term factors (FAO, 2009b; von Braun and Torero, 2009). FAO concluded, “provisional estimates show that, in 2007, 75 million more people were added to the total number of undernourished relative to 2003–05” (FAO, 2008); this is arguably a low-end estimate (Headey and Fan, 2010). More than enough food is currently produced per capita to feed the global population, yet about 870 million people remained hungry in the period from 2010 to 2012 (FAO et al., 2012). The questions for this chapter are how far climate and its change affect current food production systems and food security and the extent to which they will do so in the future (Figure 7-1).},

The results presented herein suggest that coasts fronted by relatively narrow reefs with steep fore reef slopes ({\~{}}1:10 and steeper) and deeper, smoother reef flats are expected to experience the highest wave runup. Wave runup increases for higher water levels (sea level rise), higher waves and lower bed roughness (coral degradation), which are all expected effects of climate change. Rising sea levels and climate change will therefore have a significant negative impact on the ability of coral reefs to mitigate the effects of coastal hazards in the future.},

abstract = {Rainfall monitoring via satellite sensors is particularly relevant for the agricultural sector of West Africa. Indeed, food shortages in this region are often caused by rainfall deficits and an early access to data available for the entire region can help to provide credible and timely information for better decision making. This study assesses the accuracy of state-of-the-art satellite rainfall retrievals for agriculture applications in two sites in Niger and Benin. Although these satellite data are widely used instead of rain gauge data for such applications, we found that, in a crop-modelling framework, their use can introduce large biases in crop yield simulations. Biases differ strongly among the four cultivars considered in both sites and are not simple extrapolation of each satellite product cumulative rainfall amount biases. In particular, we found that if an accurate estimation of the annual cumulative rainfall amount is important for yield simulations of pearl millet 'Souna 3' and 'Somno' cultivars in Niger, a realistic distribution of rainfall is also very important for predicting pearl millet 'Somno' and 'HK' yields in Niger as well as maize yields in Benin. Overall the satellite products tested, 3B42v6 appears to be the most suitable satellite product for our specific agricultural application since it minimizes both biases in rainfall distribution and in annual cumulative rainfall amount. For each crop and in both regions, biases in crop yield prediction are the highest when using non-calibrated satellite rainfall products (PERSIANN, 3B42RT, CMORPH and GSMAP). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Transformation of agricultural systems, for example switching crop types or moving out of agriculture, is projected to be necessary in some cases. However, little attention has been paid to the timing of these transformations. Here, we develop a temporal uncertainty framework using the CMIP5 ensemble to assess when and where cultivation of key crops in sub-Saharan Africa becomes unviable. We report potential transformational changes for all major crops during the twenty-first century, as climates shift and areas become unsuitable. For most crops, however, transformation is limited to small pockets ({\textless}15{\%} of area), and only for beans, maize and banana is transformation more widespread ({\~{}}30{\%} area for maize and banana, 60{\%} for beans). We envisage three overlapping adaptation phases to enable projected transformational changes: an incremental adaptation phase focused on improvements to crops and management, a preparatory phase that establishes appropriate policies and enabling environments, and a transformational adaptation phase in which farmers substitute crops, explore alternative livelihoods strategies, or relocate. To best align policies with production triggers for no-regret actions, monitoring capacities to track farming systems as well as climate are needed.},

Therefore the loss of structural complexity in reefs due to human drivers (eutrophication, overfishing, climate change) may affect the survival and growth of reef fish. This paper uses data from an unfished reserve in the Bahamas to show that structural complexity is associated with increased biomass and abundance, as well as with nonlinearities in the size spectra of fish. These nonlinearities (i.e. the disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes) are shown to be explained by prey refugia, which reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Using a size-structured food web model, a loss of complexity was predicted to cause more than a 3-fold.},

abstract = {In West Africa, agriculture, mainly rainfed, is a major economic sector and the one most vulnerable to climate change. A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty.Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from -50{\%} to +90{\%}, the median is a yield loss near -11{\%}. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, -18{\%} median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, -13{\%}) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near -15{\%} with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation.The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, fostering innovation in the region's smallholder farming systems will require more decentralized, adaptive, and heterogeneous institutional structures and approaches than presently exist. In this paper, we review the conditions that have been undermining sustainable food and nutrition security in the Caribbean, focusing on issues of history, economy, and innovation. Building on this discussion, we then argue for a different approach to agricultural development in the Small Island Developing States of the CARICOM that draws primarily on socioecological resilience and agricultural innovation systems frameworks. Research needs are subsequently identified, including the need to better understand how social capital can facilitate adaptive capacity in diverse smallholder farming contexts; how formal and informal institutions interact in domestic agriculture and food systems to affect collaboration, co-learning, and collective action; how social actors might better play bridging and linking roles that can support mutual learning, collaboration, and reciprocal knowledge flows; and the reasons underlying past innovation failures and successes to facilitate organizational learning.},

The objective of this research was to narrow the range of values characterizing the limits within which estimates are expected to fall in the diagnostics of agroclimatic risks. Assessments were made by analyzing historical observations and evaluating the influence of heat stress and rainfall variability on crop water demand, biomass and grain yields of short-cycle cultivars of pearl millet and maize. We used a wide range of consistent and practical sets of crop model ensemble analyses (based on crop management practices such as plant density, fertilization levels, early/late sowing dates and soil types) and climate model ensembles from 2 climate change hypothesis (A1b and RCP8.5) over the West African Sudan-Sahel. Recent rainfall developments show that hazardous intra-seasonal rainfall distribution affects crop productivity, with increased frequency and intensity of daily rainfall, false start and early cessation of the rainy season and decreasing diurnal temperature range. In 2011-2050 perspectives, relative to the 1981-2010 baseline, a slight in - crease in temperature (i.e. +0.6 to +0.8{\^{A}}°C) combined with a stationary to moderate decrease in precipitation leads to a 10 to 15{\%} (8 to 15{\%}) decrease in aboveground biomass production (grain yield). When the warming is moderate (i.e. +1.4 to 1.8{\^{A}}°C), the decline in grain yield worsens (10 to 20{\%}), despite a slight increase in rainfall projections. At these rates of loss in crop production, resilience can be reinforced. However, it will require that climate-smart crop management practices be embedded in sub-seasonal and interannual monitoring and early warning systems. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2015.},

Observations already indicate an average increase in temperature of between 0.2 and 0.8 degrees C; when projected, this increases further to between 3.0 and 4.0 degrees C.

abstract = {Climate variability and change is regarded as having major impacts on key sustainable socio-economic and environmental indicators in Sub-Saharan West Africa. Because of these concerns, we investigated smallholders knowledge, skills, and aspirations about managing climate change, and document adaptation strategies used in the semi-arid regions coming from Burkina Faso, Chad and Niger. We analyzed climate data from the 1950's to the present, including daily and aggregated rainfall and temperature variability, trends and extremes. We also examined farmer perceptions of climate, particularly with what was expected and what was actually observed. Field data was collected through: (i) a semi-structured survey administered to 478 head households; (ii) from focus groups through discussion and consultation with local stakeholders by using a risk matrix. The main agro-climatic risks for farmers in these countries are: Increasing maximum and minimum temperatures; high rainfall variability; and, extreme droughts and floods. We were able to work with communities to identify and prioritize authentic climate change adaptation measures that were deemed to be both strategic and complementary to prudent natural resource management and enhanced agricultural production. Identified innovative adaptation practices that may be up-scaled include: expanding irrigation systems, adjusting crop planting times to suit localized weather and climate forecasts, plant breeding to establish more heat-stress tolerant crops and associated agroforestry. In dryland rainfall systems, it was acknowledged there is a need for greater reliance on water-stress tolerant crops, better soil and water conservation techniques associated with broad catchment management and agroforestry, and improving soil management through prudent fertilizers in sorghum crops. To address climate change, such practices need immediate wider-scale implementation.},

abstract = {Ocean acidification poses an increasing threat to marine ecosystems and also interacts with other anthropogenic environmental drivers. A planned response strategy could minimize exposure of socioeconomic systems to potential hazards and may even offer wider advantages. Response strategies can be informed by understanding the hazards, assessing exposure and assessing risks and opportunities. This paper assesses exposure of key socioeconomic systems to the hazards of ocean acidi- fication and analyzes the risks and opportunities of this exposure from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) perspectives. Key socioeconomic systems that are likely to be affected by ocean acidification are identified. A risk analysis matrix is developed to evaluate the risks or opportunities arising from ocean acidification. Analysis of the matrix reveals similarities and differences in potential adaptive responses at global and regional levels. For example, while ocean acidification poses significant threats to SIDS from more frequent toxic wild-caught seafood events and, potentially destruction of coral reef structure and habitat, SIDS may have a relative advantage in aquaculture and an important role to play in global marine ecosystem conservation.},

abstract = {Tourism is a major global economic sector that is undergoing tremendous growth in emerging economies and is often touted as salient for development and poverty alleviation in developing countries. Tourism is recognized as a highly climate-sensitive sector, one that is also strongly influenced by environmental and socioeconomic change influenced by climate change, and is also a growing contributor to anthropogenic climate change. This article outlines the complex interrelationships between climate change and the multiple components of the international tourism system. Five focal themes that have developed within the literature on the consequences of climate change for tourism are then critically reviewed: climatic change and temporal and geographic shifts in tourism demand, climate-induced environmental change and destination competitiveness within three major market segments (winter sports tourism, coastal tourism, and nature-based tourism), and mitigation policy developments and future tourist mobility. The review highlights the differential vulnerability of tourism destinations and that the resultant changes in competitiveness and sustainability will transform some international tourism markets. Feedbacks throughout the tourism system mean that all destinations will need to adapt to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and climate policy. While notable progress has been made in the last decade, a number of important knowledge gaps in each of the major impact areas, key regional knowledge gaps, and both tourist and tourism operator perceptions of climate change risks and adaptive capacity indicate that the tourism sector is not currently well prepared for the challenges of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The repercussions of climate change will be felt in various ways throughout both natural and human systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate change projections for this region point to a warming trend, particularly in the inland subtropics; frequent occurrence of extreme heat events; increasing aridity; and changes in rainfall—with a particularly pronounced decline in southern Africa and an increase in East Africa. The region could also experience as much as one meter of sea-level rise by the end of this century under a 4 ?C warming scenario. Sub-Saharan Africa's already high rates of undernutrition and infectious disease can be expected to increase compared to a scenario without climate change. Particularly vulnerable to these climatic changes are the rainfed agricultural systems on which the livelihoods of a large proportion of the region's population currently depend. As agricultural livelihoods become more precarious, the rate of rural–urban migration may be expected to grow, adding to the already significant urbanization trend in the region. The movement of peopleinto informal settlements may expose them to a variety of risks different but no less serious than those faced in their place of origin, including outbreaks of infectious disease, flash flooding and food price increases. Impacts across sectors are likely to amplify the overall effect but remain little understood.},

abstract = {We investigate household-level food security in the face of climatic change in coastal wetland-situated households in Trinidad and Tobago. These communities rely heavily, but not solely, on natural resources and agriculture for their livelihoods. Household data were collected for a representative sample of 138 households in the Nariva and Caroni communities. This included data on household adaptive capacity including socio-demographics, livelihood strategies, and social networks; exposure to climate change and climate-induced extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts; and sensitivity factors related to local access to services and infrastructure. Using ordinary least-squares regression analyses, we investigate influences of adaptive capacity to climate change on household food security in these `at-risk' communities. The results suggest that household socio-demographics and livelihood strategies are strongly related to food security and that the level of food security provided by those two factors is reduced in the face of climate variability and disaster. Social network capacity of households does not have a statistically significant influence in the context studied. This is a valuable insight for community and national planners and policy makers both in this and in similar country circumstances that must consider food security in light of climate variability and related weather-induced impacts.},

Consequently, support to adaptation needs to be complemented with research that can generate contextual information to inform adaptation policies, strategies, and measures. Interventions need to go beyond just technical fixes such as the development of new crop varieties, and must be based on an understanding of how different factors interact in a complex manner to drive risks and results in specific contexts to diverse outcomes.},

Such differences in climate and impacts projections between the Western and Eastern parts of the Sahel are highly consistent across the climate and crop models used in this study. We investigate the robustness of impacts for different choices of cultivars, nutrient treatments, and crop responses to CO2. Adverse impacts on mean yield and yield variability are lowest for modern cultivars, as their short and nearly fixed growth cycle appears to be more resilient to the seasonality shift of the monsoon, thus suggesting shorter season varieties could be considered a potential adaptation to ongoing climate changes. Easing nitrogen stress via increasing fertilizer inputs would increase absolute yields, but also make the crops more responsive to climate stresses, thus enhancing the negative impacts of climate change in a relative sense.},

abstract = {West Africa is known to be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to high climate variability, high reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and limited economic and institutional capacity to respond to climate variability and change. In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation.},

abstract = {This paper gives insight into the political economy of climate compatible development (CCD) in Ghana's artisanal fisheries, focusing on two contentious policy areas that both have the potential to offer “triple-win” benefits, but in practice may not: the subsidized premix fuel provided to artisanal fishermen, and mangrove protection. Regarding the premix fuel subsidy, it is highly opposed by artisanal fishermen who argue that it would damage their livelihoods, and it may force fishermen into alternative, potentially unsustainable livelihoods. Regarding mangrove protection, there is insufficient funding and administrative coordination across ministries and agencies, meaning it is neglected. Therefore, a major constraint to CCD is institutional failing, rather than a lack of policies. The paper emphasises that CCD needs to be conceptualised as a process that is dynamic across space and time, and that pressure from a number of actors, including grass-roots actors, may demand short-term improvements to current problems rather than aspiring to triple-win outcomes in the long-term, creating challenges for CCD. There is also an overview of artisanal fishing in Ghana, and the impacts of climate change.},

Three challenges are highlighted: (1) ensuring the appropriate scope for action; (2) moving beyond intervention-based decision guidance; and (3) developing long-term shared capacity for strategic planning. To overcome these challenges we have applied explorative scenarios and normative back-casting with stakeholders from different sectors at the regional level in East Africa. We then applied lessons about appropriate scope, enabling adaptation pathways, and developing strategic planning capacity to scenarios processes in multiple global regions. Scenarios were created to have a broad enough scope to be relevant to diverse actors, and then adapted by different actor groups to ensure their salience in specific decision contexts. The initial strategy for using the scenarios by bringing a range of actors together to explore new collaborative proposals had limitations as well as strengths versus the application of scenarios for specific actor groups and existing decision pathways. Scenarios development and use transitioned from an intervention-based process to an embedded process characterized by continuous engagement. Feasibility and long-term sustainability could be ensured by having decision makers own the process and focusing on developing strategic planning capacity within their home organizations.},

@article{Webber:2014gh,
abstract = {In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) efforts to achieve food security are challenged by poverty, low soil fertility, unequal global trade relationships, population growth, weak institutions and infrastructure, and future climate changes and variability. Crop models are the primary tools available to assess the impacts of climate change and other drivers on crop productivity, a key aspect of food security. This review examines their role and suitability for informing climate change adaptation decisions in the SSA context. Perception of climate change is rarely the only factor leading to changed farming practices, with labor availability, recent extreme climatic events (floods or droughts) and access to formal credit, constituting the main factors farmers respond to. Further, farmers' socio-economic status constrains the adaptations they make in response to these drivers. Many crop modeling studies reviewed investigating climate change adaptation currently do not capture many of these drivers, adaptations nor constraints. However, a number of areas were identified where crop models could aid in adaptations decision-making. For instance, crop models can: test which changes farmers are making are most robust to future climate scenarios; be used as tools for experimentation in farmer organizations to build farmer capacity, minimize risk and empower farmers; be linked to economic, farm systems or livestock models to widen the scope of potential impacts, adaptations and farmer constraints considered, and to probe the interactions of cropping systems with other systems; and evaluate various indicators of resilience. Finally it is suggested that one of the greatest benefits of linking crop models across disciplines and in integrated assessment frameworks may be providing a platform to bring specialists and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds together to assess climate change adaptation options to enhance food security in SSA. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A long history of household-level research has provided important local-level insights into climate adaptation strategies in the agricultural sector. It remains unclear to what extent these strategies are generalizable or vary across regions. In this study we ask about three potential key factors influencing farming households' ability to adapt: access to weather information, household and agricultural production-related assets, and participation in local social institutions. We use a 12-country data set from sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to explore the links between these three potential drivers of agricultural change and the likelihood that farmers made farm-associated changes, such as adopting improved crop varieties, increasing fertilizer use, investing in improved land management practices, and changing the timing of agricultural activities. We find evidence that access to weather information, assets, and participation in social institutions are associated with households that have reported making farming changes in recent years, although these results vary across countries and types of practices. Understanding these drivers and outcomes of farm-associated changes across different socio-economic and environmental conditions is critical for ongoing dialogues for climate-resilient strategies and policies for increasing the adaptive capacity of smallholders under climate change. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

The analysis shows that in absolute terms, production shortfalls relative to demand for starchy staples (particularly rice and wheat) will continue to pose a major challenge for ECOWAS countries. In relative terms, however, imbalances between domestic production and demand will increase more quickly for foods with high income-elasticities of demand, such as meat, dairy products, seafood, fruits and vegetables and vegetable oils. Urban demand will grow two to four times faster than rural demand, depending on the commodity, putting increased pressure on already stressed urban food marketing systems. Substantial variations in supply-demand gaps across countries suggest that more fluid regional trade could help individual countries cope with these challenges. The findings also suggest that the focus of food policies in West Africa, historically on starchy staples (particularly cereals) needs to broaden to include a range of higher-value products for which demand is likely to increase very rapidly in the near future.},
