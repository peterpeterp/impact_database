@article{Sultan2016,
	Abstract = {West Africa is known to be particularly vulnerable to climate change due to high climate variability, high reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and limited economic and institutional capacity to respond to climate variability and change. In this context, better knowledge of how climate will change in West Africa and how such changes will impact crop productivity is crucial to inform policies that may counteract the adverse effects. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on agriculture inWest Africa based on the recent scientific literature.West Africa is nowadays experiencing a rapid climate change, characterized by a widespread warming, a recovery of the monsoonal precipitation, and an increase in the occurrence of climate extremes. The observed climate tendencies are also projected to continue in the twenty-first century under moderate and high emission scenarios, although large uncertainties still affect simulations of the future West African climate, especially regarding the summer precipitation. However, despite diverging future projections of the monsoonal rainfall, which is essential for rain-fed agriculture, a robust evidence of yield loss in West Africa emerges. This yield loss is mainly driven by increased mean temperature while potential wetter or drier conditions as well as elevated CO2 concentrations can modulate this effect. Potential for adaptation is illustrated for major crops in West Africa through a selection of studies based on process-based crop models to adjust cropping systems (change in varieties, sowing dates and density, irrigation, fertilizer management) to future climate. Results of the cited studies are crop and region specific and no clear conclusions can be made regarding the most effective adaptation options. Further efforts are needed to improve modeling of the monsoon system and to better quantify the uncertainty in its changes under a warmer climate, in the response of the crops to such changes and in the potential for adaptation.},

@article{Tanner2014a,
	Abstract = {This paper gives insight into the political economy of climate compatible development (CCD) in Ghana's artisanal fisheries, focusing on two contentious policy areas that both have the potential to offer ``triple-win'' benefits, but in practice may not: the subsidized premix fuel provided to artisanal fishermen, and mangrove protection. Regarding the premix fuel subsidy, it is highly opposed by artisanal fishermen who argue that it would damage their livelihoods, and it may force fishermen into alternative, potentially unsustainable livelihoods. Regarding mangrove protection, there is insufficient funding and administrative coordination across ministries and agencies, meaning it is neglected. Therefore, a major constraint to CCD is institutional failing, rather than a lack of policies. The paper emphasises that CCD needs to be conceptualised as a process that is dynamic across space and time, and that pressure from a number of actors, including grass-roots actors, may demand short-term improvements to current problems rather than aspiring to triple-win outcomes in the long-term, creating challenges for CCD. There is also an overview of artisanal fishing in Ghana, and the impacts of climate change.},

	Abstract = {This paper reviews impacts and discusses potential adaptation strategies adopted by the artisanal and industrial fishing sectors. Both climate change and over-exploitation have altered species composition of catches. Climate change impacts on West African fisheries are projected to be mainly negative (although modelling outputs disagree over the direction of change in some regions). Warmer water species are increasing in dominance. Regardless of the differences in projected climate change effects, the ultimate impacts on local communities will depend on adaptive capacity, which is not well-studied. Both artisanal and industrial sectors may adapt by expanding the fishing ground, even though this increases operation costs. Historically, it is more common for industrial fisheries to change the target species than for artisanal fisheries, which challenges the prevailing assumption that artisanal fisheries would adapt by shifting target species and/or gear type. The preference of artisanal fisheries to ``follow the fish'' rather than change gear / species may be due to traditional diets and available markets. An increase in fishing costs may lead to a reduction in fishing effort, which while good for fisheries may mean loss of livelihoods, especially as in West Africa the opportunities for alternative livelihoods are limited. Methods: literature review of the impacts of climate change on two West African large marine ecosystems (economic performance, biologic productivity and diversity), the changes witnessed by industrial and artisanal fisheries in response to changing conditions, and the adaptation measures used by artisanal and industrial fisheries to similar changes (whether due to climate change or other stressors).},

In$\backslash$nWest Africa, a region extremely vulnerable to climate change, various$\backslash$nstudies predicted significant reduction in productivity of the major$\backslash$ncrops because of future warming and shift in precipitation patterns.$\backslash$nHowever, most studies either follow statistical approaches or involve$\backslash$nonly specific sites.

@article{Roudier2011a,
	Abstract = {In West Africa, agriculture, mainly rainfed, is a major economic sector and the one most vulnerable to climate change. A meta-database of future crop yields, built up from 16 recent studies, is used to provide an overall assessment of the potential impact of climate change on yields, and to analyze sources of uncertainty.Despite a large dispersion of yield changes ranging from -50{\%} to +90{\%}, the median is a yield loss near -11{\%}. This negative impact is assessed by both empirical and process-based crop models whereas the Ricardian approach gives very contrasted results, even within a single study. The predicted impact is larger in northern West Africa (Sudano-Sahelian countries, -18{\%} median response) than in southern West Africa (Guinean countries, -13{\%}) which is likely due to drier and warmer projections in the northern part of West Africa. Moreover, negative impacts on crop productivity increase in severity as warming intensifies, with a median yield loss near -15{\%} with most intense warming, highlighting the importance of global warming mitigation.The consistently negative impact of climate change results mainly from the temperature whose increase projected by climate models is much larger relative to precipitation change. However, rainfall changes, still uncertain in climate projections, have the potential to exacerbate or mitigate this impact depending on whether rainfall decreases or increases. Finally, results highlight the pivotal role that the carbon fertilization effect may have on the sign and amplitude of change in crop yields. This effect is particularly strong for a high carbon dioxide concentration scenario and for C3 crops (e.g. soybean, cassava). As staple crops are mainly C4 (e.g. maize, millet, sorghum) in WA, this positive effect is less significant for the region. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Agriculture is a key component of anthropogenic land use and land cover changes that influence regional climate. Meanwhile, in addition to socioeconomic drivers, climate is another important factor shaping agricultural land use. In this study, we compare the contributions of climate change and socioeconomic development to potential future changes of agricultural land use in West Africa using a prototype land use projection (LandPro) algorithm. The algorithm is based on a balance between food supply and demand, and accounts for the impact of socioeconomic drivers on the demand side and the impact of climate-induced crop yield changes on the supply side. The impact of human decision-making on land use is explicitly considered through multiple "what-if" scenarios. In the application to West Africa, future crop yield changes were simulated by a process-based crop model driven with future climate projections from a regional climate model, and future changes in food demand were projected using a model for policy analysis of agricultural commodities and trade. Without agricultural intensification, the climate-induced decrease in crop yield together with increase in food demand are found to cause a significant increase in agricultural land use at the expense of forest and grassland by the mid-century. The increase in agricultural land use is primarily climate-driven in the western part of West Africa and socioeconomically driven in the eastern part. Analysis of results from multiple decision-making scenarios suggests that human adaptation characterized by science-informed decision making to minimize land use could be very effective in many parts of the region.},

Historically, the region has experienced decades of severe drought along with cycles of above average rainfall which have greatly affected agricultural production. Future projections indicate decreased rainfall over the Sahel coastline. Observations already indicate an average increase in temperature of between 0.2 and 0.8 degrees C; when projected, this increases further to between 3.0 and 4.0 degrees C. Of greater concern, however, is the late onset, early cessation dates of rainfall and reduction of length of growing period (LGP) which are now locally negatively impacting agriculture in the region. Furthermore, projections indicate a 20{\%} reduction of LGP in 2050. These results represent essential input for accelerating agricultural adaptation to climate change.

	Abstract = {Rainfall monitoring via satellite sensors is particularly relevant for the agricultural sector of West Africa. Indeed, food shortages in this region are often caused by rainfall deficits and an early access to data available for the entire region can help to provide credible and timely information for better decision making. This study assesses the accuracy of state-of-the-art satellite rainfall retrievals for agriculture applications in two sites in Niger and Benin. Although these satellite data are widely used instead of rain gauge data for such applications, we found that, in a crop-modelling framework, their use can introduce large biases in crop yield simulations. Biases differ strongly among the four cultivars considered in both sites and are not simple extrapolation of each satellite product cumulative rainfall amount biases. In particular, we found that if an accurate estimation of the annual cumulative rainfall amount is important for yield simulations of pearl millet 'Souna 3' and 'Somno' cultivars in Niger, a realistic distribution of rainfall is also very important for predicting pearl millet 'Somno' and 'HK' yields in Niger as well as maize yields in Benin. Overall the satellite products tested, 3B42v6 appears to be the most suitable satellite product for our specific agricultural application since it minimizes both biases in rainfall distribution and in annual cumulative rainfall amount. For each crop and in both regions, biases in crop yield prediction are the highest when using non-calibrated satellite rainfall products (PERSIANN, 3B42RT, CMORPH and GSMAP). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops and links highly resolved models of physical, biological and human responses to climate change in 67 marine national exclusive economic zones (60{\%} of global fish catches) to project climate change yield impacts in countries with different dependencies on marine fisheries. Productivity is projected to increase at high latitudes and decrease at mid-low latitudes, with considerable regional variation. Changes by 2050 are largely expected to be {\textless}10{\%} from present yields. Of the regions that are most dependent on fisheries, climate change is expected to increase productive potential in West Africa (from Benin to Mauritania) and decrease it in South and Southeast Asia, and in Southwest Africa (from Nigeria to Namibia). Technological development in aquaculture suggests that projected global fish demands in 2050 could be met, although this requires successful implementation of strategies for sustainable harvesting and effective distribution of wild fish products from nations and regions with a surplus to those with a deficit. Changes in management effectiveness and trade practices will remain the main influence on gains or losses in global fish production. For example, in West Africa nations where production in the EEZs is projected to increase by 2050, governments must ensure that distant water fishing nations do not jeopardize local opportunities to benefit from increased productivity.

	Abstract = {Uses an ``end-to-end climate-to-fish-to-fisheries'' approach to show how changes to the atmosphere-ocean are likely to affect food webs, habitats and stocks underpinning fisheries and aquaculture across the regions. Some fisheries benefit -- tuna are expected to be more abundant in the east and freshwater aquaculture and fisheries are likely to become more productive. Conversely, coral reef fisheries could decrease by 20{\%} by 2050 and coastal aquaculture may be less efficient (this is more difficult to model). The paper also shows how social and economic implications can be addressed: tuna and freshwater aquaculture can help to support growing populations as coral reefs, costal fisheries and mariculture decline. The introduction gives a good overview of how important fishing is to the economies and food security of Pacific islands. The paper also lists further research needs. Methods: changes to the topical Pacific Ocean and surface climate from the SRES A2 emissions scenario were cascaded along direct and indirect pathways to show which oceanic, coastal and freshwater fisheries and aquaculture resources will be affected by 2035, 2050 and 2100, and how this will affect economic development, food security, and livelihoods. A Spatial Ecosystem and Population Dynamics model is used to show how fisheries will change.},

	Abstract = {Tourism is a growing economic sector in the South Pacific providing the region with great potential for economic development. Vanuatu and its neighbouring Small Island Developing States and Territories experience a high vulnerability to climate change impacts. The tourism sector in Vanuatu is particularly vulnerable, and it needs to develop and implement effective adaptation strategies to reduce climate change risks. Policies play an important role by providing the platform on which adaptation can occur and resilience be built. This study examines the policy environment in Vanuatu for its conduciveness to climate change adaptation. It identifies the types of adaptation processes (explicit or implicit) and types of adaptation measures (technical, business management, behavioural, policy, and research and education) and critically analyses the current tourism-related policies for their effectiveness in assisting the sector to address climate change. It is found that the majority of policies identified deal with climate change through implicit adaptation processes and mainly through the use of policy and research and education measures. The authors argue that in order to strengthen the resilience of the tourism industry, the Government of Vanuatu needs to develop and implement explicit climate change adaptation policies for the tourism sector.},

It has been noted, however, that the uncertainty in the projected changes in the frequency of very intense tropical cyclones, particularly the changes in the regional frequency, is very large. Here we present a projection of the changes in the frequency of intense tropical cyclones estimated by a statistical downs- caling of ensemble of many high-resolution global model experiments. The results indicate that the changes in the frequency of very intense (category 4 and 5) tropical cyclones are not uniform on the globe. The frequency will increase in most regions but decrease in the south western part of Northwest Pacific, the South Pacific, and eastern part of the South Indian Ocean.},

To investigate these possible variations, El Ni{\~{n}}o events were divided into three categories based on where the largest September--February sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies occur: warm pool El Ni{\~{n}}o (WPE), cold tongue El Ni{\~{n}}o (CTE), and mixed El Ni{\~{n}}o (ME), between the other two.Large-scale SST and wind patterns for each type of El Ni{\~{n}}o show distinct and significant differences, as well as shifts in rainfall patterns in the main convergence zones. As a result, November to April rainfall in many Pacific island countries is significantly different among the El Ni{\~{n}}o types.

	Abstract = {A numerical model, XBeach, calibrated and validated on field data collected at Roi-Namur Island on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of Marshall Islands, was used to examine the effects of different coral reef characteristics on potential coastal hazards caused by wave-driven flooding and how these effects may be altered by projected climate change. The results presented herein suggest that coasts fronted by relatively narrow reefs with steep fore reef slopes ({\~{}}1:10 and steeper) and deeper, smoother reef flats are expected to experience the highest wave runup. Wave runup increases for higher water levels (sea level rise), higher waves and lower bed roughness (coral degradation), which are all expected effects of climate change. Rising sea levels and climate change will therefore have a significant negative impact on the ability of coral reefs to mitigate the effects of coastal hazards in the future.},

However, substantial interannual and interdecadal variability, which are larger locally than globally, mean that it is not possible to say if recent trends in the Cook Islands region are representative of longer-term trends, or if longer-term trends have increased recently. Local fisheries management decisions should therefore focus on observations at the local and regional scales. For example, in the short-term (the next 10-20 years) interannual variability in sea level is likely to provide a larger impact on low-lying islands than change in sea level, but sea level rise will become a big concern on a century time scale.},

They use the vulnerability assessment performed by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (Bell et al. 2011) to describe the main oceanic fisheries in the tropical Pacific, summarise existing benefits, outline the plans for maintaining or improving these benefits, examine how tuna could be affected by a high GHG gas scenario to 2100, evaluate the implications of projected changes in contributions of oceanic fisheries to Pacific island economies and communities, and identify the key adaptations needed (win-win and lose-win options). To determine the economic effects, they use historic GDP and revenues from fisheries together with projected changes in tuna catch from Lehodey et al. 2011. Islands in the east are projected to receive increased economic benefits, but by 2050 the expected decline in catches in the west more than offsets the increase in the east (although islands in the west tend to be the more economically reliant on fisheries). The impacts on food security are relatively minor compared to the effects of population growth, and those more vulnerable islands must allocate an adequate proportion of their average tuna catches to national food security.},

@article{Graham2015d,
	Abstract = {This paper documents and predicts long-term reef responses to a major climate-induced coral bleaching event that caused unprecedented region-wide mortality of Indo-Pacific corals. After loss of {\textgreater}90{\%} live coral cover, 12 of 21 reefs recovered towards pre-disturbance live coral status, while 9 reefs underwent regime shifts to fleshy microalgae. Regime shifting reefs saw changes in functional diversity of reef fish communities. The paper identifies threshold values for a range of factors that accurately predicted ecosystem response to the bleaching event -- recovery was favoured when reefs were structurally complex and in deeper water, when density of juvenile corals and herbivorous fishes was relatively high and when nutrient loads were low. Pre-disturbance quantification of simple factors such as structural complexity and water depth accurately predicted ecosystem trajectories, which can guide improved management and adaptation. Methods: they use a 17-year data set across the inner islands of the Seychelles, which were the most severely affected globally by the 1998 coral bleaching event. Note that the study was conducted in the Indian Ocean, but the findings were also checked with data from 6 other countries, including Fiji.},

Actual coping mechanisms utilized after extreme events: savings; credits; wait and see (see Table 3 for results). 23{\%} of sample have high, 33{\%} moderate demand for micro-insurance, with dominating reasons against insurance being cost of premiums (44{\%}), lack of trust (27{\%}) (see page 107). Other limitations that affect the viability of insurance as an adaptation option include: affordability; the weakness of publicly-funded insurance schemes; lack of public knowledge of risks and insurance; difficulties in reaching a larger proportion of the population due to a shortage of information on local weather risks; and insufficient risk-management and risk- transfer experience on the part of the initiators.},

There is a growing realization that availability will be vulnerable to extremes of climate behavior and increasing demand for water. Climate modeling for the Caribbean region under a range of scenarios suggests a continuation of a warming in average temperatures, a lengthening of seasonal dry periods, and increases in frequency of occurrence of drought conditions. Using information from the most recent IPCC report and regional downscaling, the authors suggest what some of the macrolevel changes in temperature and rainfall might be and the implications for water resources availability. This article evaluates the existing availability of water resources, the implications of the most recent climate change modeling for the Caribbean region, and the impact of on existing service provision strategies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate household-level food security in the face of climatic change in coastal wetland-situated households in Trinidad and Tobago. These communities rely heavily, but not solely, on natural resources and agriculture for their livelihoods. Household data were collected for a representative sample of 138 households in the Nariva and Caroni communities. This included data on household adaptive capacity including socio-demographics, livelihood strategies, and social networks; exposure to climate change and climate-induced extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts; and sensitivity factors related to local access to services and infrastructure. Using ordinary least-squares regression analyses, we investigate influences of adaptive capacity to climate change on household food security in these `at-risk' communities. The results suggest that household socio-demographics and livelihood strategies are strongly related to food security and that the level of food security provided by those two factors is reduced in the face of climate variability and disaster. Social network capacity of households does not have a statistically significant influence in the context studied. This is a valuable insight for community and national planners and policy makers both in this and in similar country circumstances that must consider food security in light of climate variability and related weather-induced impacts.},

	Abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is used to map areas predicted to be suitable for commercial banana production in Central and northwestern South America. Using the downscaled climate projections for 2060 from seven leading global climate models we then predict the geographical shifts in areas suitable for banana production. We repeat this process for conventional and organic banana production. Approximately half of the existing conventional plantations included in the analysis are located in areas predicted to become unsuitable for banana production by 2060. The overall extent of areas suitable for conventional banana cultivation is predicted to decrease by 19{\%}, but all countries are predicted to maintain some suitable areas. The extent of areas suitable for organic banana cultivation is predicted to nearly double due primarily to climatic drying. Several countries (e.g., Colombia and Honduras) are predicted to experience large net decreases in the extent of areas suitable for banana cultivation. Some countries (e.g., Mexico) are predicted to experience large net increases in the extent of suitable areas. The shifts in the location of areas that will be suitable for banana cultivation are predicted to occur mainly within areas outside of protected areas and that are already under agricultural production. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore the loss of structural complexity in reefs due to human drivers (eutrophication, overfishing, climate change) may affect the survival and growth of reef fish. This paper uses data from an unfished reserve in the Bahamas to show that structural complexity is associated with increased biomass and abundance, as well as with nonlinearities in the size spectra of fish. These nonlinearities (i.e. the disproportionately high abundances of certain size classes) are shown to be explained by prey refugia, which reduce mortality rates and alter growth rates in different parts of the size spectrum. Using a size-structured food web model, a loss of complexity was predicted to cause more than a 3-fold.},

	Abstract = {This is the 9th status report since the global coral reef monitoring network (GCRMN) was founded in 1995. It reviews the status and changes observed in reefs over the period 1970-2012, covering biological abundance, anthropogenic drivers of coral reef degradation, and recommendations for management. The report also includes country reports for the countries, states and territories in the Caribbean, therefore giving quite a high level of resolution. Data were taken from more than 35,000 ecological surveys, making it the largest amount of quantitative coral reef survey data ever compiled (at the time of writing). Key findings: average coral cover for the wider Caribbean is 16.8{\%} (range 2.8-53.1{\%}), having been 34.8{\%} at the start of the period, and coral cover declined at ¾ of locations while macroalgal cover increased. Some locations showed more stability. Local stressors (tourism, overfishing and the resulting increase in macroalgae) have been the major drivers of catastrophic decline in corals up to today, but climate chance and ocean acidification may become more important in the future.},

	Abstract = {Over the past 40 years, two of the dominant reef-building corals in the Carbibean have experienced unprecedented declines, which has been largely attributed to white-band disease. This paper hindcasted the potential relationship between recent ocean warming and outbreaks in white-band disease on acroporid corals, using eight SST metrics and records of the corals from 473 sites across the Caribbean, surveyed from 1997 to 2004. The results suggest that decades-long climate-driven changes in SST, increases in thermal minima, and the breach of thermal maxima have played significant roles in the spread of white-band disease, showing that this disease is strongly coupled with the thermal stresses associated with climate change.},

	Abstract = {The intent of this paper is to place the con- cepts of exposure, vulnerability, resilience and risk in the context of the consequences of global change for the sustainable development of small island developing states (SIDS). Many such states face a number of global climate change risks, such as an increase in the propor- tion of more intense storms, along with other global change threats that include energy security and costs. All these threats come on top of local development threats, such as increased run-off, often with increasing levels of contaminants due to unsustainable agricultural and industrial practices. When taken together, the resulting pressures on islands and their communities lead to sig- nificant increases in vulnerability to change due to reduced resilience to these changes. Vulnerability is also increasing as a result of contemporary processes that heighten the exposure of material and other assets. The capacity to address hazard risk also influences vulnera- bility.

Vulnerability and resilience are considered to be important integrating concepts when managing the local consequences of global changes. There are many initiatives that will help reduce the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of SIDS to such changes. These include improving risk knowledge and coastal resource and land use management, while also strengthening socio-economic systems and livelihoods. In this way, managing global change can be closely aligned with local development and humanitarian processes, thereby enhancing the overall sustainability of development processes and outcomes.

	Abstract = {Ocean acidification poses an increasing threat to marine ecosystems and also interacts with other anthropogenic environmental drivers. A planned response strategy could minimize exposure of socioeconomic systems to potential hazards and may even offer wider advantages. Response strategies can be informed by understanding the hazards, assessing exposure and assessing risks and opportunities. This paper assesses exposure of key socioeconomic systems to the hazards of ocean acidi- fication and analyzes the risks and opportunities of this exposure from Small Island Developing States (SIDS) perspectives. Key socioeconomic systems that are likely to be affected by ocean acidification are identified. A risk analysis matrix is developed to evaluate the risks or opportunities arising from ocean acidification. Analysis of the matrix reveals similarities and differences in potential adaptive responses at global and regional levels. For example, while ocean acidification poses significant threats to SIDS from more frequent toxic wild-caught seafood events and, potentially destruction of coral reef structure and habitat, SIDS may have a relative advantage in aquaculture and an important role to play in global marine ecosystem conservation.},

Significant positive associations were found between lethality and percentage of total land dedicated to agriculture and percentage urban population (i.e. urbanization). This fits with other research that suggests that well-preserved ecosystems in combination with infrastructure can offer could protection against the impacts of hurricanes. Deaths were more likely in the 2000-2012 period vs. 1980-1989, adding to evidence that population health in CARICOM nations is being increasingly impacted by climate-related disasters connected to increasing urbanization and land use patterns.},

	Abstract = {Climate change could have major implications for the global tourism industry if changing environmental conditions alter the attractiveness of holiday destinations. Countries with economies dependent on tourism and with tourism industries reliant on vulnerable natural resources are likely to be particularly at risk. We investigate the implications that climate-induced variations in Atlantic hurricane activity may have for the tourism-dependent Caribbean island of Anguilla. Three hundred tourists completed standardised questionnaires and participated in a choice experiment to determine the influence hurricane risk has on their risk perceptions and decisions regarding holiday preferences. The hurricane season had been considered by 40 {\%} of respondents when making their holiday choice, and the beaches, climate and tranquility of the island were more important than coral reef-based recreational activities in determining holiday destination choice. Choice models demonstrated that respondents were significantly less likely to choose holiday options where hurricane risk is perceived to increase, and significantly more likely to choose options that offered financial compensation for increased risk. However, these choices and decisions varied among demographic groups, with older visitors, Americans, and people who prioritize beach- based activities tending to be most concerned about hurricanes. These groups comprise a significant component of the island's current clientele, suggesting that perceived increases in hurricane risk may have important implications for the tourism economy of Anguilla and similar destinations. Improved protection of key environmental features (e.g. beaches) may be necessary to enhance resilience to potential future climate impacts.},
